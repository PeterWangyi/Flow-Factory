"""Single-root module bundle for distributed training.

`ModelBundle` wraps several trainable / frozen-shardable modules (e.g. one or
more transformers, plus a value critic) as ONE ``nn.Module`` so that
``accelerator.prepare`` wraps a single root. This is required by DeepSpeed (one
engine per ``prepare``) and FSDP2 (one root) — they cannot wrap multiple models.
It also lets a frozen member (e.g. Wan2.2's inactive transformer) be FSDP-sharded
for memory while only the ``requires_grad`` subset is trained.

`RoutedComponentProxy` is the transparent proxy installed as an adapter component
after ``prepare``: calling it routes the forward through the (wrapped) bundle
root — which is what drives DDP's gradient reducer / FSDP's param all-gather /
the DeepSpeed engine — while attribute access (``.config``, ``.dtype``,
``.parameters()``, ``cache_context``, ``disable_adapter`` ...) delegates to the
inner module so existing adapter code is unchanged.
