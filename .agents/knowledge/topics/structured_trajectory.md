# Structured Trajectory

**Read when**: Changing rollout collection, replay bridges, index maps, callbacks, active masks, or
multi-component scheduler/noise order.

## Authority and shape

- `BaseSample.trajectory is None`: legacy trajectory fields are authoritative.
- `BaseSample.trajectory` is present: `StructuredTrajectory` is authoritative and all five legacy
  trajectory fields stay `None`. LTX2 is the reference multi-component adapter.
- `component_order` defines scheduler, RNG, replay, and reduction order.
- Each component retains independent state shape, schedule, state/transition maps, callbacks,
  component log probabilities, and active masks.

For T transitions:

| Collection | Rollout positions | Index-map length |
|---|---:|---:|
| States | initial plus post-transition states | T + 1 |
| Joint/component log probabilities | transitions | T |
| Transition callbacks | transitions | T |

`-1` means a rollout position was not collected. A whole absent category uses a `None` tensor/map
container, never an all-`-1` placeholder. Sparse terminal-only state collection is valid.

## Both storage formats, one trainer-facing API

Thirteen of the eighteen registered adapter variants still emit legacy trajectories. The two LTX2
workflows and three MiniMax H3 workflows emit structured ones.
That dual track is deliberately invisible above the bridge: no trainer reads `all_latents`,
`latent_index_map` or `log_prob_index_map`, and the format branch exists only inside
`trajectory_bridge`. Keep it that way — a trainer that indexes storage directly re-couples every
algorithm to the migration state.

Trainers consume both formats through adapter-owned bridge APIs:

- `get_terminal_state`
- `get_replay_step`
- `get_replay_callback`
- `add_forward_process_noise` / `apply_forward_process_noise`
- `reduce_component_latent_values` / `reduce_latent_values`

Bridge-owned state/noise arguments have one source and must not be forwarded again from batch
conditioning. Active masks exclude immutable conditioning positions from noising, log-probability
reduction, and losses.

## Trainer matrix

| Trainer | Structured consumption |
|---|---|
| GRPO / GRPO-Guard / DPPO | Coupled replay; transition statistics and joint/component log probabilities |
| DiffusionNFT / AWM / DPO | Terminal state plus ordered forward-process noise |
| DGPO | Deterministic per-UID component noise in `component_order` |
| CRD | Global two-pass order; pass two rebuilds state from stored component noise |
| DMD2 / TDM / TDM-R1 | Terminal state plus ordered forward-process noise; TDM conditional re-noising restores each component's boundary dtype after float32 likelihood math |
| DiffusionOPD | Requires homogeneous scheduler-group dynamics; no reward/advantage stage |

Single-component adapters retain legacy bit-parity: generalizing a reduction to N components
changes floating-point association order, so the one-component case keeps its original arithmetic
rather than routing through the general path (see `trainers/distillation/opd/common.py`). Multi-component
reductions preserve one scalar per sample while averaging only active degrees of freedom, so
sequence length or conditioning tokens cannot change objective scale.

Implementation: `src/flow_factory/samples/trajectory.py`,
`src/flow_factory/models/trajectory_bridge/`, and trainer `optimize()` paths.

Shared assembly, rather than per-family copies:

| Helper | Location | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `unstack_structured_trajectories()` | `samples/trajectory.py` | Inverse of `StructuredTrajectory.stack`: batched component tensors -> one trajectory per sample. Families keep only their own validation and any concatenated-tensor splitting. |
| `reduce_component_log_probs()` | `models/component_reduction.py` | Degrees-of-freedom-weighted joint log probability. Shape-agnostic, so a per-step `(B,)` and a stored `(B, T)` both reduce identically. |

`trajectory_bridge/` is split by responsibility: `replay.py` (read stored trajectories out of a
collated batch), `noising.py` (forward-process noise), `dispatch.py` (resolve conditioning and
dispatch one replayed step), `score.py` (velocity-to-score projection for distillation),
`masks.py` (active-mask geometry), `reduction.py` (component reduction entry points).
`__init__.py` re-exports the public surface; `BaseAdapter` imports the package under the alias
`bridge`, so each delegation reads as `bridge.get_replay_step(...)`.

## Review checklist

- [ ] State maps use T + 1; transition maps use T.
- [ ] Uncollected positions use `-1`; wholly absent categories use `None`.
- [ ] Component order, schedules, callbacks, log probabilities, and active masks remain aligned.
- [ ] Trainers use adapter bridge APIs rather than direct legacy indexing.
- [ ] Single-component behavior remains bit-parity compatible.
- [ ] Multi-component reductions count active degrees of freedom only.
- [ ] DiffusionOPD rejects mixed dynamics.
