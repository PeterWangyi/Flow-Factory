# Component Runtime

**Read when**: Changing component discovery, loading, lifecycle, scheduler groups, or distributed
preparation.

## Runtime matrix

| Backend | Runtime | Loading contract |
|---|---|---|
| Eager diffusers pipeline | `ClassicPipelineRuntime` | `load_pipeline()` returns materialized components |
| Lazy modular pipeline | `ModularPipelineRuntime` | specs are declared first; explicit names materialize modules |
| Explicit non-diffusers container | `PseudoPipelineRuntime` | canonical roots and non-enumerated aliases are declared explicitly |

All adapters implement `load_pipeline()`. Non-classic adapters also override
`build_component_runtime()`. `adapter.pipeline` remains the backend compatibility alias.

## Lookup and enumeration

- **Canonical lookup** returns the backend-owned component or declaration.
- **Override lookup** returns a prepared proxy or LoRA/checkpoint replacement without changing
  canonical ownership.
- **Declared names/specs** are available for explicit lookup and role discovery.
- **Materialized names** include canonical `torch.nn.Module` instances only.
- Device/dtype lifecycle enumeration excludes declared-only specs, optional `None` entries,
  pseudo aliases, and prepared/replacement overrides.
- `materialize_components(None)` means already-materialized modules. Lazy specs require explicit
  names.

Implementation: `src/flow_factory/models/runtime/` and
`src/flow_factory/models/abc.py::BaseAdapter`.

## Canonical identity

The runtime is the only authority on which components exist. Never test membership with
`hasattr(adapter, name)`. That only agrees with the runtime for backends whose components happen
to be adapter properties; a lazy or modular runtime declares components that are never attributes,
and those silently drop out of every `hasattr`-gated loop. A declared training target that never
reaches the optimizer produces an empty parameter list rather than an error, which looks like a
training bug rather than a configuration one. Aliasing such a component onto `self.transformer`
does not fix it: that registers an extra override named `transformer` while the real component
stays invisible to the gated loops.

Use the three-way distinction:

| Question | Call |
|---|---|
| Does the runtime declare this name? | `adapter.has_component(name)` |
| Give me the module, tolerating a declared-optional absence | `adapter.get_component(name)` |
| Give me the module, this loop cannot proceed without it | `adapter._require_component(name)` |

`get_component` returns `None` for a component the backend declares but leaves unset — a Wan 2.1
checkpoint has no `transformer_2`, an image-only pipeline has no `audio_vae`. Dereferencing that
yields a bare `AttributeError` naming neither the component nor the loop, so lifecycle loops that
need a real module go through `_require_component`, which names the component and the declared set.

Overrides must name a declared component: one installed under an unknown name is unreachable,
because every reader resolves through the declared set. `_load_full_model` writes through
`set_component()` so a replacement stays visible to the runtime instead of shadowing it with a bare
instance attribute.

## Scheduler and distributed boundaries

- `adapter.scheduler` is the canonical primary scheduler.
- `SchedulerGroup.names` is immutable and equals `trajectory_component_order`.
- `SchedulerGroup` owns ordered mode and seed dispatch; mapping iteration never defines RNG order.
- `ModelBundle` plus `RoutedComponentProxy` is the sole distributed preparation runtime.
- Trainer stages call public adapter lifecycle methods so model-specific overrides remain active.
- `ModelLoadCoordinator` compiles logical names and physical roots into one immutable load plan;
  its backend runtime owns rank-zero/meta target loading and replicated auxiliary/reward loading.
- A target-owned composite root may still contain frozen auxiliary siblings. Pseudo runtimes move
  only that remainder and exclude every prepared target route.

## Activation-checkpoint ownership

`configure_checkpointing_backend_plan()` resolves one owner before model loading; direct trainer
construction repeats the same plan defensively after adapter realization.

| FSDP plan | Activation-checkpoint owner |
|---|---|
| FSDP1 with train-level model checkpointing | Model-side owner; a simultaneously enabled backend owner is disabled |
| FSDP1 + TDM-R1 | Both owners are disabled because reference/snapshot forwards invalidate FSDP1 recomputation |
| FSDP2 with no train-level model policy | The configured backend policy is retained; otherwise checkpointing stays off |
| FSDP2 with a full train-level policy | Accelerate/FSDP2 backend wrappers own recomputation; the train-level model policy is disabled |
| FSDP2 with a selective train-level policy | Rejected because backend wrappers cannot preserve selective model boundaries |
| FSDP2 with an adapter-owned in-forward capability | The adapter installs block-local boundaries after the FSDP input cast; the duplicate plugin owner is disabled during preparation |

MiniMax H3 Ref2VA currently owns the adapter-specific exception. Its prepared FSDP units also
receive a replay-time public `unshard()` hook for the affected PyTorch lifecycle, where a second
checkpoint graph can replay after another graph resharded the same unit. These flags are
model-specific memory policy and must not be copied to another adapter without evidence.

## Fix records

### Repeated-block metadata must survive the distributed bundle boundary

- **Date**: 2026-08-30
- **Symptom**: Two-rank LTX2 FSDP2 runs exhausted a 95 GiB GPU while
  `fully_shard()` initialized the prepared model root, before the first training step.
- **Root Cause**: LTX2 declares its 48 transformer units through Diffusers'
  `_repeated_blocks`, but `ModelBundle` surfaced only `_no_split_modules` to Accelerate;
  the empty auto-wrap policy therefore sharded the complete 19B transformer as one unit.
- **Fix**: `ModelBundle._no_split_modules` now falls back to `_repeated_blocks` for a
  member that has no legacy no-split declaration, with a regression that resolves the
  repeated block class through Accelerate's transformer-based FSDP policy.
- **Lesson**: A distributed wrapper becomes the metadata boundary seen by backend
  policy discovery. It must preserve both legacy and current model block declarations,
  or a correct component graph can silently collapse into one memory-prohibitive shard.
- **Related Constraint**: #9

## Failure modes

- Expanding omitted materialization to all declarations loads tokenizers, configs, and weights
  unexpectedly.
- Enumerating aliases or overrides as lifecycle roots moves or wraps the same parameters twice.
- Including optional `None` declarations in role groups fails during freeze/device operations.
- Preparing components outside `ModelBundle` breaks FSDP/DeepSpeed root ownership.
- Building scheduler order from mappings breaks deterministic multi-component RNG dispatch.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Canonical, override, declared, and materialized paths remain distinct.
- [ ] Membership resolves through the runtime, never `hasattr` on the adapter.
- [ ] A loop that dereferences a component uses `_require_component`.
- [ ] Lazy loading names every required component explicitly.
- [ ] Lifecycle enumeration contains canonical modules only.
- [ ] `adapter.pipeline`, `adapter.scheduler`, and public lifecycle hooks remain compatible.
- [ ] Scheduler names equal `trajectory_component_order`.
- [ ] Distributed preparation still routes through `ModelBundle`/`RoutedComponentProxy`.
- [ ] Exactly one activation-checkpoint owner remains active for the selected FSDP plan.
