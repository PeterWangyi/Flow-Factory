## Six-Stage Training Pipeline

> Authoritative reference: `guidance/workflow.md`

```
Stage 1: Data Preprocessing (offline, cached)
  │  GeneralDataset + adapter.preprocess_func()
  │  Text/image/video/audio → encoded tensors (prompt_embeds, image_latents, audio_features, ...)
  │  Result cached with hash fingerprint
  ▼
Stage 2: K-Repeat Sampling
  │  Three sampler strategies (see `topics/samplers.md`):
  │  - GroupContiguousSampler (preferred, auto-selected): keeps K copies on same rank
  │  - DistributedKRepeatSampler (fallback): shuffles K copies across ranks
  │  - GroupDistributedSampler (DGPO): rank-identical prompt sequence, K/W copies per rank
  │  K = training_args.group_size
  ▼
Stage 3: Trajectory Generation
  │  adapter.inference() — full multi-step SDE/ODE denoising
  │  Produces: generated images/videos + trajectory data (noises, log-probs)
  ▼
Stage 4: Reward Computation
  │  RewardProcessor dispatches to Pointwise or Groupwise models
  │  Multi-reward aggregation with configurable weights
  ▼
Stage 5: Advantage Computation
  │  AdvantageProcessor (advantage/advantage_processor.py)
  │  Communication-aware: auto-selects gather vs local path
  │  Strategies: "sum" (weighted-sum, GRPO) or "gdpo"
  ▼
Stage 6: Policy Optimization
  │  adapter.forward() — single-step denoising for loss computation
  │  Policy gradient (GRPO) or weighted matching (NFT/AWM) or DPO preference loss
  │  Gradient update via accelerator
  ▼
  (Repeat Stages 2–6 for next epoch)
```

**Trainer methods vs stages** (each epoch, after Stage 1):

| Method | Stages |
|--------|--------|
| `sample()` | 2–3 (K-repeat batches + `adapter.inference` trajectories) |
| `prepare_feedback()` | 4–5: reward buffer finalize, `AdvantageProcessor` |
| `optimize()` | 6: `adapter.forward` and optimizer step (DPO: form chosen/rejected pairs at entry, then loss) |

## Registry System

All four registries map string keys → lazy import paths. Resolution: registry lookup → fallback to direct Python path → dynamic import. See `trainers/registry.py`, `models/registry.py`, `rewards/registry.py`, `acceleration/registry.py` for implementation.

### Registered Components

**Trainers** (`trainers/registry.py`):

| Key | Class | Paradigm | Base Class |
|-----|-------|----------|------------|
| `grpo` | `GRPOTrainer` | Coupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `grpo-guard` | `GRPOGuardTrainer` | Coupled | `GRPOTrainer` |
| `dppo` | `DPPOTrainer` | Coupled | `GRPOTrainer` |
| `dpo` | `DPOTrainer` | Decoupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `dgpo` | `DGPOTrainer` | Decoupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `nft` | `DiffusionNFTTrainer` | Decoupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `awm` | `AWMTrainer` | Decoupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `crd` | `CRDTrainer` | Decoupled | `BaseTrainer` |
| `diffusion-opd` | `DiffusionOPDTrainer` | Distillation (on-policy) | `BaseTrainer` |

**Flat hierarchy**: New trainers inherit from `BaseTrainer` directly. The sanctioned exceptions are `GRPOGuardTrainer → GRPOTrainer` and `DPPOTrainer → GRPOTrainer` (strict GRPO loss variants; see constraint #11).

**Model Adapters** (`models/registry.py`):
| Key | Class | Task |
|-----|-------|------|
| `sd3-5` | `SD3_5Adapter` | Text-to-Image |
| `flux1` | `Flux1Adapter` | Text-to-Image |
| `flux1-kontext` | `Flux1KontextAdapter` | Image-to-Image |
| `flux2` | `Flux2Adapter` | Text-to-Image & Image(s)-to-Image |
| `flux2-klein` | `Flux2KleinAdapter` | Text-to-Image & Image(s)-to-Image |
| `qwen-image` | `QwenImageAdapter` | Text-to-Image |
| `qwen-image-edit-plus` | `QwenImageEditPlusAdapter` | Image(s)-to-Image |
| `z-image` | `ZImageAdapter` | Text-to-Image |
| `wan2_t2v` | `Wan2_T2V_Adapter` | Text-to-Video |
| `wan2_i2v` | `Wan2_I2V_Adapter` | Image-to-Video |
| `wan2_v2v` | `Wan2_V2V_Adapter` | Video-to-Video |
| `ltx2_t2av` | `LTX2_T2AV_Adapter` | Text-to-Audio-Video |
| `ltx2_i2av` | `LTX2_I2AV_Adapter` | Image-to-Audio-Video |
| `bagel` | `BagelAdapter` | Text-to-Image & Image(s)-to-Image (T2I & I2I both batched via NaViT packing; subset-round packing handles variable I2I reference-image count, no per-sample fallback — see `topics/adapter_conventions.md`) |

**Reward Models** (`rewards/registry.py`):
| Key | Class | Type |
|-----|-------|------|
| `pickscore` | `PickScoreRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `pickscore_rank` | `PickScoreRankRewardModel` | Groupwise |
| `clip` | `CLIPRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `clap` | `CLAPRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `imagebind` | `ImageBindRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `ocr` | `OCRRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `vllm_evaluate` | `VLMEvaluateRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `rational_rewards_t2i` | `RationalRewardsT2IRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `rational_rewards_edit` | `RationalRewardsEditRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `geneval` | `GenEvalRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `geneval2_soft_tifa` | `GenEval2SoftTIFARewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `hpsv2` | `HPSv2RewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `hpsv3_service` | `HPSv3ServiceRewardModel` | Pointwise |
| `qwen_image_bench` | `QwenImageBenchRewardModel` | Pointwise |

**Accelerators** (`acceleration/registry.py`):
| Key | Class | Safety | Stage | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| `attention_backend` | `AttentionBackendAccelerator` | lossless | both | Sets the diffusers attention backend on every transformer (requires a `backend` param). Listed as a `shared` entry (before `torch_compile`); this is the single code path for backend selection (the old `BaseAdapter._set_attention_backend` and the `model.attn_backend` knob were both removed — a config still setting `model.attn_backend` fails fast). Bagel forces flash_attention_2 at load and does not use it. |
| `torch_compile` | `CompileAccelerator` | lossy | both | `torch.compile` of the shared transformer (`auto` default: regional when `_repeated_blocks` is available, otherwise full; explicit regional/full overrides); applied in-place after `post_init` so checkpoint keys / param identity stay stable. Marked `lossy` because it is applied symmetrically but is **not bit-exact across rollout vs training** (Inductor's grad/no-grad graph split → intermittent ~1e-5 on-policy residual, within `clip_range`); still allowed on coupled algos, validator warns. |
| `diffusers_cache` | `DiffusersCacheAccelerator` | lossy | rollout | Diffusers `CacheMixin` feature caching (first_block/faster/pyramid/taylorseer/magcache), gated by the adapter's explicit `supports_diffusers_cache` capability before any component is mutated. |

Configured via the `acceleration:` block (`hparams/acceleration_args.py`): two ordered lists of `{name, params}` entries — `shared` (persistent `stage='both'` accelerators applied to rollout and training) and `rollout` (Stage-3 only). **List order is application order**: `shared` entries run their `setup()` in order (so `attention_backend` must precede `torch_compile`), and `rollout` entries nest their `rollout_context()` in order. The `acceleration/validator.py` enforces that a **lossy `rollout`** accelerator runs only on `decoupled`/`distillation` trainers (each trainer declares a `paradigm`), preserving train-inference consistency (constraint #7). A **lossy `stage='both'` accelerator in the `shared` slot** (e.g. `torch_compile`, applied symmetrically but not bit-exact across stages) is allowed on any paradigm but the validator **warns** on coupled trainers that the on-policy ratio will be ≈1, not exactly 1. Off by default.

## Extension Points

- **New model adapter**: `guidance/new_model.md`, skill `/ff-new-model`, conventions `topics/adapter_conventions.md`
- **New reward model**: `guidance/rewards.md`, skill `/ff-new-reward`
- **New algorithm**: `guidance/algorithms.md`, skill `/ff-new-algorithm`. `BaseTrainer` owns the epoch loop (`start`), timestep sampling, feedback/advantages, the optimizer step and the velocity KL; only `optimize()` is abstract. Vary behavior through `sampling_context`, `_run_training_step`, `_after_gradient_step` and `_after_optimizer_step` rather than by restating the loop. An algorithm that trains several model copies declares them in `_declare_model_variants()` (`topics/component_variants.md`).
- **New accelerator**: subclass `acceleration/abc.py::BaseAccelerator` (declare `safety`/`stage`), register in `acceleration/registry.py`

## Key Design Patterns

### Timestep & Sigma Convention

Timesteps are `[0, 1000]` (scheduler scale); sigmas are `[0, 1]` (flow-matching noise level). Details: `topics/timestep_sigma.md`.

### Adapter Pattern (Models)
Each model adapter wraps a diffusers pipeline into the `BaseAdapter` interface:
- `preprocess_func()` — offline encoding (Stage 1)
- `inference()` — full denoising loop (Stage 3)
- `forward()` — single-step denoising (Stage 6)

**Per-modality encoders** (`encode_prompt`, `encode_image`, `encode_video`, `encode_audio`) are no-op by default on `BaseAdapter` — override only the modalities your model consumes. `preprocess_func` dispatches to all four and skips any that return `None`, so text/image/video-only adapters need no stub overrides for unused modalities.

**Flat hierarchy**: All adapters inherit directly from `BaseAdapter` — never from another adapter (see constraint #12). Shared logic within a model family uses helper functions, code duplication, or mixins — not adapter subclassing.

Details: `topics/adapter_conventions.md`

### Sample Dataclass Hierarchy
Two-layer structure (constraint #14): task-level samples (`T2ISample`, `I2VSample`, `I2AVSample`, ...) live in `samples/samples.py` and inherit from `BaseSample` or condition mixins. Model-specific samples (`LTX2Sample`, `LTX2I2AVSample`, ...) inherit from the matching task-level sample — never from another model-specific sample.

`BaseSample.trajectory` is the opt-in structured path for independently shaped/timed latent
components; legacy trajectory fields remain unchanged and authoritative when it is `None`.
LTX2 T2AV/I2AV rollouts are the first adapters to opt in: they publish an authoritative
`StructuredTrajectory` and leave every legacy trajectory field `None`
(see `topics/adapter_conventions.md` gotcha #12).

### Component Management
`BaseAdapter` delegates component discovery, canonical access, runtime overrides, lazy
materialization, and stage-device lifecycle to `models/runtime/`. Runtime overrides include
prepared/proxied modules and LoRA/checkpoint replacements; all are excluded from manual device
management. Declared lazy specs are separate from materialized module enumeration, so stage-wide
operations and `materialize_components(None)` never materialize tokenizers, schedulers, processors,
or configs implicitly. Explicit names are required to materialize a lazy spec. Role groups retain
non-`None` modular specs but exclude absent classic optional components. The default
`ClassicPipelineRuntime` preserves eager DiffusionPipeline behavior;
`ModularPipelineRuntime` materializes selected lazy component specs; and
`PseudoPipelineRuntime` manages explicit containers and non-enumerated aliases such as Bagel's
`transformer -> bagel.language_model`. `adapter.pipeline` remains the backend compatibility alias,
while `ModelBundle` and `RoutedComponentProxy` remain the sole distributed preparation runtime.
`SchedulerGroup` separately provides immutable component names and ordered scheduler mode/seed
dispatch; its primary scheduler remains available through `adapter.scheduler`.

Component membership resolves through the runtime, never through `hasattr(adapter, name)`:
`has_component` asks whether a name is declared, and `_require_component` fetches a module a
lifecycle loop cannot proceed without. Details: `topics/component_runtime.md`.

### Component Variants
`BaseAdapter` is infrastructure: it supplies mechanisms and holds no algorithm vocabulary. Two
mechanisms cover parameter ownership. Named parameter snapshots (`add_named_parameters` /
`use_named_parameters`) are temporal, one set of weights installed at a time, and cover references,
EMAs and old snapshots. `ComponentVariantRegistry` (`models/variants.py`) is spatial: several
trainable copies live at once, each with its own optimizer group, storage (`lora` or `full`) and
`component_routes`. Variant names are caller-chosen and the base variant is positional, so the
model layer never learns what a "generator" is. `RoutedComponentProxy` resolves a canonical
component name through the active variant, so adapter code is unchanged.

A variant is always a live trainable copy. A frozen reference is the same weights at another point
in time, so it belongs to the temporal mechanism: `use_ref_parameters()` for the pre-finetune
weights, or a named snapshot. Only the trainable copy carries gradients and optimizer state, which
is what forces it into the prepared bundle in the first place.

Roles are the trainer's vocabulary. `RoleOptimizationCoordinator`
(`trainers/role_optimization.py`) is a utility a trainer composes to drive disjoint role updates
through one physical optimizer, and `BaseTrainer._validate_multirole_backend` rejects the
distributed layouts multi-role cannot support. Algorithms may duplicate their own small role
helpers rather than share an abstraction that would push their vocabulary down a layer.
Details: `topics/component_variants.md`.

#### Component runtime enumeration boundaries
- **Date**: 2026-08-10
- **Symptom**: Lazy stage-wide operations could materialize non-module specs, Bagel's nested
  transformer could be moved twice, and trainers bypassed adapter lifecycle overrides.
- **Root Cause**: The first runtime abstraction conflated declared specs, materialized modules,
  aliases, and prepared/replacement overrides under one component-name path.
- **Fix**: Split declared and materialized discovery, added non-enumerated pseudo aliases and
  generic device-excluded overrides, and restored trainer routing through adapter lifecycle APIs.
- **Lesson**: Discovery for explicit lookup and enumeration for lifecycle operations require
  separate contracts; aliases and overrides must remain addressable without becoming lifecycle
  roots.
- **Related Constraint**: #5.

#### Optional role discovery and lazy default materialization
- **Date**: 2026-08-10
- **Symptom**: A declared classic `transformer_2=None` entered the transformer role group and
  adapter freezing called `requires_grad_` on `None`; separately, `materialize_components(None)`
  eagerly loaded every modular spec.
- **Root Cause**: Role discovery filtered names rather than non-`None` values, and the default
  materialization request expanded declared names instead of materialized modules.
- **Fix**: Role discovery now excludes `None` values while retaining non-`None` modular specs;
  default materialization uses already-materialized module names, and normal canonical lookup
  returns direct materialized attributes before consulting the expensive declared component map.
- **Lesson**: Optional declarations are valid for explicit compatibility lookup but cannot imply
  role membership, and an omitted lazy-materialization selection must never mean "load all."
- **Related Constraint**: #5.

#### Structured trajectory bridge ownership boundaries
- **Date**: 2026-08-10
- **Symptom**: Batch-level state arguments could be forwarded twice, partial active-count
  overrides were rejected, and a plain mapping with structured trajectory data raised an
  incidental attribute error.
- **Root Cause**: The legacy bridge did not separate bridge-owned forward arguments from
  batch conditioning, and treated optional component metadata as a complete mapping.
- **Fix**: The bridge now strips state-owned batch keys, accepts ordered partial active-count
  overrides while rejecting unknown components, and validates the structured batch type before
  accessing batch metadata.
- **Lesson**: Bridge-owned values must have one authoritative source; optional component
  metadata should be consumed in authoritative component order without requiring every key.
- **Related Constraint**: #5, #26.

### Reward Processing
`RewardProcessor` dispatches by model type:
- **Pointwise**: batch by `batch_size`
- **Groupwise**: group by `unique_id` (local or distributed path)
- **Multi-reward**: weighted aggregation
- **Async**: optional non-blocking computation

### Advantage Computation
`AdvantageProcessor` (`advantage/advantage_processor.py`): communication-aware, auto-selects gather vs local path. Strategies: `"sum"` (GRPO) and `"gdpo"`. All reward-based trainers delegate to `self.advantage_processor.compute_advantages()`; the distillation trainer `diffusion-opd` is the exception (its `prepare_feedback()` is a no-op — no reward/advantage stage).
